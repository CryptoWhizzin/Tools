Digital Invisible Ink Toolkit 1.0
======================================

This is the public release of the toolkit, and may contain bugs.


Introduction
------------

This tool is a cross-platform steganography program.  It can embed any
sort of file inside an image, and regarding the method and password are
known, this can be retrieved at a later stage.


Release Detail
--------------

This version has a rudimentary gui which supports all of the algorithms
for hiding.  It should be run on java 1.4 with the java advanced imaging
toolkit (jai) or with java 1.5.  If it is not run on these versions of java
it will very likely not write out the final images.
