Added a "NoMessageException" which is thrown when the retrieved message 
size is larger than the space (as calculated with algorithm settings and
given image).  
Fixed typo in the Prewitt and Sobel filters.
Added cancel button to the "Working please wait" panel.
Added LSB Matching for all algorithms.


February 2006
------------------------------
Added the ability to see how much space left in an image (for both encoding and simulating).
Also added "Explain" button which gives a short synopsis of what the algorithm does.

January 2006
---------------------------
